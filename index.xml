      <title>DIY 3 Element Yagi Antenna for 2m VHF</title>

      <description>I decided to build an simple Yagi antenna for my APRS I-gate.
I ended up on the yagi design because it helps lower the noise floor at my location by reducing the signal from a broadcast FM located nearby.
I simulated the antenna using a program called xnec2c.

      <title>How I got started in open source</title>

      <description>My journey into open source began with the web browser Firefox. When I first tried it in 2005, I was really impressed with how well it worked compared to Internet Explorer. This is what put the concept of open source on my radar.
A few months after, that I gave Ubuntu a go on my first laptop and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe how little ram was used, and how much better file transfer over USB worked in GNU/Linux.</description>

      <description>I wrote this after the death of our beloved Great Dane name Diesel.
 Last Day with Diesel free of collar and of leash he paused to keep the pace,
we watched with apprehension fearing pain upon his face
he stood and looked around him that gray and misty day,
in a field, his domain, that had just been cleared of hay
he paused for a moment, while the breeze brought him a smell,</description>

      <title>Why I tend to use open source stuff</title>
      <link>https://caseyjamesdavis.github.io/hobbies/opensource/whyopensource/</link>

      <description>When possible, I gravitate towards open source options when choosing software or hardware.
I prefer to use open source stuff for the following reasons:
 I don&amp;rsquo;t have to deal with license keys There are usually multiple options - I can try them all and pick the one I like best My data isn&amp;rsquo;t held hostage by a proprietary format At work, I don&amp;rsquo;t need to ask permission to use a new software If it breaks there is usually more information available to aid in the fix There is often better online support Using, installing, and maintaining it is a challenge and this forces me to learn new things I can participate in improvements  </description>

      <title>Off Past Canaan</title>

      <description>I wrote this for my grandmother&amp;rsquo;s memorial service. Both of my grandparents enjoyed snowmobiling from the late 60&amp;rsquo;s until their passing. The above photo and many childhood memories were inspiration for this poem.
 Off Past Canaan The clock chimed high from the southern wall,
signaling the end of the dinner call.
The television is off, the suit is found,
the wood stove is stuffed so it won&amp;rsquo;t go out.</description>
