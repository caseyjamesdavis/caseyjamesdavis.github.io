      <description>I was able to measure the VSWR of my Yagi antenna using a random noise source, directional coupler, and RTL-SDR.&#xA;A program called rtl_power_fftw was used to measure the noise signal reflected back to the RTL-SDR by the antenna. The VSWR was calculated and plotted using Python in a Jupyter Notebook. It shows a VSWR of about 1.5 over most of the 2m band.</description>

      <description>I decided to build a simple Yagi antenna for my APRS I-gate.&#xA;I ended up on the yagi design because it helps lower the noise floor at my location by reducing the signal from a broadcast FM station located nearby.&#xA;I simulated the antenna using a program called xnec2c.</description>
