      <description>A Touch of Applesoft BASIC came with the Apple IIc Plus that I excitedly received on Christmas day in 1988. Due to games like Oregon Trail and Think Quick! I am certain that I didn&amp;rsquo;t even open the book until several years later. Before this book I did not understand that it was possible for a normal person to write a computer program and run it on a computer.
 There was a reference in the back of the book that pointed to Applesoft BASIC Programmer&amp;rsquo;s Reference Manual and I decided that this was a must-have since it contained about 250 additional pages on the subject.</description>
