      <description>A Touch of Applesoft BASIC came with the Apple IIc Plus that I excitedly received early in the mornning on Christmas day in 1988. Due to games like Oregon Trail and Think Quick!

The last chapter in the book has many projects and I successfully built the one called &amp;lsquo;Mini Radio Transmitter&amp;rsquo; which simply sent an adjustable tone to a nearby radio.</description>
