      <description>When possible, I gravitate towards open source options when choosing software or hardware for the following reasons:&#xA;I don&amp;rsquo;t have to deal with licenses or keys There are usually multiple options - I can try them all and pick the one I like best My data isn&amp;rsquo;t held hostage by a proprietary format At work, I don&amp;rsquo;t need to ask permission to use a piece of software If it breaks there is usually more information available to aid in the fix There is often better support or at least more information on how it was built or functions Using, installing, and maintaining it is a challenge and this forces me to learn new things I can participate in improvements Easier to understand the results of a given program Can have the same software on all of my computers </description>

      <description>My journey into open source began with the Mozilla Firefox Browser. This program is what put the concept of open source software in my head.&#xA;After becoming more aware of open source, I gave the Ubuntu operating system a try and I was astounded at how little RAM was used, and how much better file transfer over USB worked.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using GNU/Linux daily since about 2006 and I now use open source stuff as much as practically possible.</description>
